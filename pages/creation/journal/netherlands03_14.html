<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">Ok, and after that?<br></span>
<i>I said:</i> you first 'cuz question was mine…<br><br>
<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">I guess you want to know last night and what I thought about it?<br>
Well I had a nice time (thanx to the alcohol :)) with a nice person. And the rest of the world has a great fantasy! But anyway I thought about the nice time we had.</span><br>
The same :)<br>
No…really the same!!<br><br>
<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">Still, use your imagination!!<br>
I want more words, what did you think, be creative!<br>
I want details! (about what you where think this morning (or maybe last night)).<br></span>
Last night (be4 go to bed) I had just one think: I liked this night 'n I remember it.
This morning I thought approximately the same and a lot things that happened  repeated in my mind.<br><br>
<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">
You a nice person and I had a great time to. It would be nice to keep the contact when you are back home.</span><br>
 Aha, I think the same :)<br>
And I want to ask if I could write not only about study maybe we can discuss some questions.<br><br>
<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">
Ofcourse! My study would bore you!<br>
Do you still want to go to Matrix?<br></span>
U asking?…more than! The problem that u study till 21 o'clock…<br><br>
<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">

<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">

<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff99cc">

<br><br>You could find your way back last night? Did you parents say something?<br></span>
